## Features

### Blazingly Fast 🚀  
Up to this date, GxHash is the fastest non-cryptographic hashing algorithm of its class, for all input sizes. This performance is possible mostly thanks to heavy usage of SIMD intrinsics, high ILP construction, a small bytecode (easily inlined and cached) and some ([outrageously unsafe](https://ogxd.github.io/articles/unsafe-read-beyond-of-death/)) tricks.  

See the [benchmarks](#benchmarks).

### Highly Robust 🗿  
GxHash uses several rounds of hardware-accelerated AES block cipher for efficient bit mixing.  
Thanks to this, GxHash passes all [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher) tests, which is the de facto quality benchmark for non-cryptographic hash functions, gathering most of the existing algorithms. GxHash has low collisions, uniform distribution and high avalanche properties.

Check out the [paper](https://github.com/ogxd/gxhash-rust/blob/main/article/article.pdf) for more technical details.

### 0 Dependencies 📦
GxHash has 0 cargo dependency. The `Hasher` and `Hashset`/`Hashmap` convenience types require the standard library, enabled by default with the `std` feature.

## Important Considerations

### Hardware Acceleration
GxHash requires a few specific hardware acceleration features, which are supported on *most* modern processors, but not all of them.
- X86 processors with `AES-NI` & `SSE2` intrinsics
- ARM processors with `AES` & `NEON` intrinsics
> **Warning**
> Other platforms are currently not supported (there is no fallback). GxHash will not build on these platforms.

In case you are building gxhash without the required features, the crate will fail to build with an error message like this (even if you know your target supports the required features): 
```
Gxhash requires aes and sse2 intrinsics. Make sure the processor supports it and build with RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" or RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+aes,+sse2"
```

To fix this, simply follow the instructions in the error message. Setting `RUSTFLAGS` to `-C target-cpu=native` should work if your CPU is properly recognized by rustc, which is the case most of the time.

### Hashes Stability
All generated hashes for a given version of GxHash are stable, meaning that for a given input the output hash will be the same across all supported platforms.

### Consistency of Hashes When Using the `Hasher` Trait
The `Hasher` trait defines methods to hash specific types. This allows the implementation to circumvent some tricks used when the size is unknown. For this reason, hashing 4 `u32` using a `Hasher` will return a different hash compared to using the  `gxhash128` method directly with these same 4 `u32` but represented as 16 `u8`. The rationale being that `Hasher` (mostly used for things like `HashMap` or `HashSet`) and  `gxhash128` are used in two different scenarios. Both way are independently stable still. 

### Unsafety
In order to achieve this magnitude of performance, this crate contains unsafe code, and a [trick](https://ogxd.github.io/articles/unsafe-read-beyond-of-death/) that some people qualify as "undefined behavior". For this reason, this crate is not intended for use in safety-critical applications, but rather for applications that require extreme hashing performance and that are less concerned about this aspect.

### Security
GxHash is seeded (with seed randomization) to improve DOS resistance and uses a wide (128-bit) internal state to improve multicollision resistance. Yet, such resistances are just basic safeguards and do not make GxHash secure against all attacks.

Also, it is important to note that GxHash is not a cryptographic hash function and should not be used for cryptographic purposes.

## Usage
```bash
cargo add gxhash
```
Used directly as a hash function:
```rust
let bytes: &[u8] = "hello world".as_bytes();
let seed = 1234;
println!(" 32-bit hash: {:x}", gxhash::gxhash32(&bytes, seed));
println!(" 64-bit hash: {:x}", gxhash::gxhash64(&bytes, seed));
println!("128-bit hash: {:x}", gxhash::gxhash128(&bytes, seed));
```

GxHash provides an implementation of the [`Hasher`](core::hash::Hasher) trait.
For convenience, this crate also provides the type aliases `gxhash::HashMap` and `gxhash::HashSet`.

```rust
use gxhash::{HashMap, HashMapExt};

let mut map: HashMap<&str, i32> = HashMap::new();
map.insert("answer", 42);
```

## Flags

### `no_std`

The `std` feature flag enables the `HashMap`/`HashSet` container convenience type aliases. This is on by default. Disable to make the crate `no_std`:

```toml
[dependencies.gxhash]
...
default-features = false
```

### `hybrid`

The `hybrid` feature flag enables a hybrid implementation of GxHash. This is disabled by default. When `hybrid` feature is enabled and for CPUs that supports it, GxHash will use wider registers and instructions (`VAES` + `AVX2`), which can lead to a significant performance improvement for large inputs. This preserves hashes stability, meaning that hashes generated with or without the `hybrid` feature are the same for a given input and seed.

*Note: Even without this feature enabled GxHash is already the fastest option out there. We recommend enabling this feature only when inputs can be larger than a few hundred bytes, see the benchmarks below.*

## Benchmarks

[![Benchmark](https://github.com/ogxd/gxhash/actions/workflows/bench.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ogxd/gxhash/actions/workflows/bench.yml)  
GxHash is continuously benchmarked on X86 and ARM GitHub runners. 

To run the benchmarks locally use one of the following:
```bash
# Benchmark throughput
# Add --features bench-md for markdown output or --features bench-plot for .svg plots
cargo bench --bench throughput

# Benchmark performance of GxHash's Hasher when used in a HashSet
cargo bench --bench hashset
```

Note: The `throughput` benchmark does not relies of criterion of timings measurements. In an attempt of reducing biais in this microbenchmark as much as possible, it shuffles seeds, input data, and alignment. It also has the benefit of being less of a "black box" compared to criterion. There is however a criterion-based throughput benchmark named `throughput_criterion` if you prefer. Results vary slightly between the two benchmarks, don't hesitate to submit an issue if you suspect biais and want to suggest improvements.

Most importantly: if performance if a critical feature for your application, don't forget to benchmark the cost of hashing in your own context. Numbers shared here may be radically different in your environment and with your hardware.

### Throughput

Throughput is measured as the number of bytes hashed per second.

*Some prefer talking of **latency** (time for generating a hash) or **hashrate** (the number of hashes generated per second) for measuring hash function performance, but those are all equivalent in the end as they all boil down to measuring the time it takes to hash some input and then apply different scalar transformation. For instance, if latency for a `4 bytes` hash is `1 ms`, then the throughput is `1 / 0.001 * 4 = 4000 bytes per second`. Throughput allows us to conveniently compare the performance of a hash function for any input size on a single graph.*
