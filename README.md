# GxHash
[![Build & Test](https://github.com/ogxd/gxhash/actions/workflows/build_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ogxd/gxhash/actions/workflows/build_test.yml)

GxHash is a [**blazingly fast**](#performance) and [**robust**](#robustness) non-cryptographic hashing algorithm.

## Usage
```bash
cargo add gxhash
```
Used directly as a hash function:
```rust
let bytes: &[u8] = "hello world".as_bytes();
let seed = 1234;
println!(" 32-bit hash: {:x}", gxhash::gxhash32(&bytes, seed));
println!(" 64-bit hash: {:x}", gxhash::gxhash64(&bytes, seed));
println!("128-bit hash: {:x}", gxhash::gxhash128(&bytes, seed));
```
Used in `HashMap`/`HashSet`:
```rust
// Type alias for HashSet::<String, GxBuildHasher>
let mut hashset = gxhash::GxHashSet::default();
hashset.insert("hello world");
```

## Features

### Blazingly Fast 🚀  
Up to this date, GxHash is the fastest non-cryptographic hashing algorithm of its class, for all input sizes. This performance is possible mostly thanks to heavy usage of SIMD intrinsics, high ILP construction and a small bytecode (easily inlined and cached).  
See the [benchmarks](#benchmarks).

### Highly Robust 🗿  
GxHash uses several rounds of hardware-accelerated AES block cipher for efficient bit mixing.  
Thanks to this, GxHash passes all [SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher) tests, which is the de facto quality benchmark for non-cryptographic hash functions, gathering most of the existing algorithms. GxHash has low collisions, uniform distribution and high avalanche properties.

Check out the [paper](https://github.com/ogxd/gxhash-rust/blob/main/article/article.pdf) for more technical details.

## Portability

### Architecture Compatibility
GxHash is compatible with:
- X86 processors with `AES-NI` intrinsics
- ARM processors with `NEON` intrinsics
> **Warning**
> Other platforms are currently not supported (there is no fallback). The behavior on these platforms is undefined.

### Hashes Stability
All generated hashes for a given version of GxHash are stable, meaning that for a given input the output hash will be the same across all supported platforms.

## Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks locally use one of the following:
```bash
# Benchmark throughput
cargo bench --bench throughput
# Benchmark performance of GxHash's Hasher when used in a HashSet
cargo bench --bench hashset
# Benchmark throughput and get output as a markdown table
cargo bench --bench throughput --features bench-md
# Benchmark throughput and get output as .svg plots
cargo bench --bench throughput --features bench-plot
```

GxHash is continuously benchmarked on X86 and ARM Github runners.

## Security

### DOS Resistance
GxHash is a seeded hashing algorithm, meaning that depending on the seed used, it will generate completely different hashes. The default `HasherBuilder` (`GxHasherBuilder::default()`) uses seed randomization, making any `HashMap`/`HashSet` more DOS resistant, as it will make it much more difficult for attackers to be able to predict which hashes may collide without knowing the seed used. This does not mean however that it is completely DOS resistant. This has to be analyzed further.

### Multicollisions Resistance
GxHash uses a 128-bit internal state. This makes GxHash [a widepipe construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%E2%80%93Damg%C3%A5rd_construction#Wide_pipe_construction) when generating hashes of size 64-bit or smaller, which had amongst other properties to be inherently more resistant to multicollision attacks. See [this paper](https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2004/31520306/multicollisions.pdf) for more details.

### Cryptographic Properties
GxHash is a non-cryptographic hashing algorithm, thus it is not recommended to use it as a cryptographic algorithm (it is not a replacement for SHA). It has not been assessed if GxHash is preimage resistant and how difficult it is to be reversed.

> I'm committed to the open dissemination of scientific knowledge. In an era where access to information is more democratized than ever, I believe that science should be freely available to all – both for consumption and contribution. Traditional scientific journals often involve significant financial costs, which can introduce biases and can shift the focus from purely scientific endeavors to what is currently trendy.
